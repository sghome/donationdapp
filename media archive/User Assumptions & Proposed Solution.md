# Week 1: Iterating idea, form team & set-up repo

## Challenge:
Sustainable Cities & Celo Peace & Prosperity Challenge

## Work-plan:

We plan to build a web-app enabling non-technical end-users & NGOs to contribute to token-bonding curves to support a variety of token incentivization and currency projects first for Sarafu Credit in Kenya led by Grassroots Economics & Red Cross.

## Synthesis of problems and actors involved:

### Local communities

The Bangla area of Nairobi, Kenya, is an example of a socially challenged community [without consistent access to conventional money](http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/search/99FCA15CAF8E24F4C1257E7E00501101). As Bangla does not have a competitive industry the trade-balance remains negative, so for all money flowing into the community it quickly flows back out again. Bangla needs demanded businesses, competitive local industry and access to a resilient currency, which does not directly have to compete with a national currency. A lack of access to a medium of exchange prohibits an efficient trade system to foster economic growth in the local economy. Dependency on national currency leaves the community exposed to currency fluctuations, even if their own small economy is thriving.

### End-users

It’s not easy to improve your future as the lack of money makes the demand side very limited and does not allow for a lot of jobs to be created. With a limited amount of money present, [the economic activity takes form informally and as barter](https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers/), utilizing your reputation in the community. Existing payments systems such as [M-Pesa or used cryptocurrencies only work if the users already have conventional money](https://ijccr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/71-84-ijccr-2018-summer-friis-glaser1.pdf) or IT skills to mine or complete bounties.

### Grassroot organizations

Organizations such as [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/), which are working on the ground in the local economy to build up resilient economic infrastructure, are only operating voluntarily or donation-based.

### Charity organizations

Charities such as Unicef and Red Cross, who operate in a developing area, pay a lot of fees to banks and money providers such as Western Union or local mobile money agents when sending conventional money. Any cash donation only has a short-term limited effect on local economies, as the end-users mostly purchase goods produced outside the community, resulting in yet further [lack of money and high administration costs](http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/search/99FCA15CAF8E24F4C1257E7E00501101).

### Philanthropic donors

End-users & companies donating into charitable organizations experience a lack of traceability, on receivers, received amount and resulting impact of their contributions. Since aid companies work with closed monetary technology, their transactions are inherently opaque to anyone outside. Not using an open technology stack, but still trying to give feedback to donors, aid companies spend large funds on marketing & reportings without specific impact KPIs.

### Impact investors

Other than traditional equity / loan deals with local entrepreneurs, there’s no way to contribute to this problem, for external investors wanting to make a difference while having the opportunity to make a profit.

## Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?

- There’s a variety of different actors involved which does not necessarily trust each other.
- There’s a need for a medium of exchange secured by robust infrastructure without any central points of failure.
- There’s a need to remove intermediaries from the money transfer process to reduce fees / costs.
- There’s a need for a transparent trusted way of tracking impact of donations without relying on unnecessary check-ups on the ground.


## What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?

- Besides derivatives, the currency market itself is the biggest in the world. The volume of donations given per year is around $410.02 billion and rising. We find that the nascent niche market of donation based community currencies is not able to be estimated at this point in time, but if the promise of 10x+ impact compared to regular donation is true, we believe this model has the potential to seriously disrupt the incumbent currency & donation markets.
- There's currently 9k users & 14k transactions in the Kenya Pilot with Red Cross. Based on the success of the Pilot the Red Cross is considering rolling this out throughout the Red Cross International Society.
- In the current Kenya pilot the donor can choose to donate directly into certain demographics such as women, kids or into organizations such as school / doctors. Secondly, the network statistics show that the added economic growth derived from the usage of community currencies has a positive impact on the whole community it's deployed.

## What other solutions are currently being used to address this problem?

- Payments: M-pesa
- Regular Donation: Unicef, Red Cross
- Crypto donation: Alice donation platform, Giveth, Givecrypto
- Community Currencies: Physical vouchers, Cyclos, Sardex, Fuse & Trustlines

# Week 2: User Personas & Pain Points


## Private Donors


### Tech Donor (target user)

Emmy is a 34 year old woman from Holland living near Amsterdam working within social impact investments. She previously completed her masters within business and has worked in the private and charity sector in Holland and in Kenya. She is passionate about development aid and likes to follow new trends in impact technologies. Emmy donates to a 12 year SOS sponsor kid from Uganda and contributes $250 a year to Unicef via monthly plans. Emmy also likes to experiment with micro-loan services for around $1000 dollars a year such as KIVA and GiveDirect to extend loans to young entrepreneurs in developing countries directly. Emmy is motivated to donate from altruistic rather than profit motives and her main goal is to make as big an impact as possible to enable a better and more fair world. Through her little brother Ray she has learned about how transparent blockchains platforms like GiveCrypto, Giveth and Alice enables to donate directly to users.

#### Pain Points

Emmy likes to know that her money comes to as good use as possible, she likes to know how her donation is spent in order to be certain that her contribution is making as big an impact as possible. With the existing solutions her current experience is:

Single-person donation: Sponsor Kid

#### Pros:

- Emmy receives an annual letter from her Sponsor Kid in Uganda, including pictures and drawings. Emmy finds this very re-affirming as she can see that the money has indeed been funding the school fee for the kid.
- Emmy also likes the personal aspect of this donation as knowing that she’s helping a specific person to have a better life is very satisfying for her.

#### Cons:

- Emmy has recently read stories online describing how some sponsor kids are being used by local people who fabricate the pictures and letters. She’d like to verify that the money is indeed funding the school, food and shelter for the kid.
- She has contacted SOS about her worry. They assured her that the money is indeed funding the school, though they do not have the resources to provide any formal documentation for each kid to verify what the money is spent on.

### Large NGO: UNICEF

#### Pros:

Emmy mainly donates to UNICEF as she knows it’s a trusted organization with the capability of doing large development efforts.
She also knows that UNICEF has a low administration costs % compared to the industry.

#### Cons:

Emmy receives an annual report from UNICEF describing all the positive changes that UNICEF has achieved throughout the year. While she likes this broad overview, Emmy would like to see more clearly exactly how much her contribution has achieved and if possible for who.


### Web2 donation platforms: KIVA / GiveDirect

#### Pro:

Emmy likes the web-first approach of these platforms, that she can see how her small contribution can enable a specific person with a specific cause, such as creating a new business, to potentially make their life and the economy in the community economically sustainable.
Emmy likes the concept of the beneficiary having to achieve certain milestones in order to receive larger donations.

#### Cons:

Emmy has sometimes had her loan paid back, and sometimes not. She’s also experienced some people completing all milestones and some very few. As she’s not really extending the loans based on profit motives, this is not a big issue for her.
In both cases, Emmy finds it pretty hard to be able to really know if the milestones were actually completed or not. She also has a hard time understanding whether the entrepreneurs are making genuine sustainable businesses or not.


### Crypto donation platforms: GiveCrypto, Giveth & Alice


#### Pros:

- Emmy loves the transparency and efficiency promises of these new techy donation platforms. She does not fully understand how it works, but she is confident that new technologies can enable financial inclusion and a more just world.
- She saw that the platforms seemed similar to KIVA / GiveDirect and was interested in experimenting.


#### Cons:

- Based on the explanation page, Emmy saw that trusted organizations / people are validating the completion of milestones similar to what she knows from KIVA / GiveDirect. She thought to herself that she did not understand how this is different with her experience from other platforms, not knowing if the money was actually spent on which impact they did.
- Out of curiosity, Emmy tried to sign up on the Alice but she gave up donating via the platform as she did not have any crypto and did not understand what she needed to do to make that happen. She would have liked to pay with her credit-card like she's used to from other donation platforms, but eventually gave up after having installed something called metamask asking her to write down some strange type of password.


### Elderly Donor

- Arnold is a 75 year old man from Denmark, who started working on a farm when he was 10, and worked his way up to be the director of a Hospital. Arnold worships Christian values and he and his wife have donated to the Red Cross via quarterly subscriptions for the last 45 years. After a conversation with his oldest daughter Karin, regarding some recent charity scandals with development aid has been funding corrupt politicians for years, Arnold has started to wonder whether development countries have become dependent and corrupted by the constant money flowing in. Arnold certainly did not want to raise his own kids in this spoiled way, as he knows from his upbringing that nothing is better to shaping one's character than to learn the lessons of an honest workday. Even though Arnold has not for a second wondered if he should cancel his Red Cross subscription (as where else would their money come to better use), Arnold would however like to be certain that he’s contribution is helping people becoming sustainable rather than making them dependent and lazy.

- Having been active for years in local politics, and known in his local community for his outspoken chronicles submissions for the local papers, Arnolds decides to write an open letter to Red Cross raising his concern. While Red Cross kindly responded, Arnold is not satisfied with their in his opinion vague answer that the donations are spent in collaborations with well-respected local partners that make sure that they are spent in a way to best possible enabling unfortunate people a better chance for a good life.

- Being a previous hospital director, Arnold is still suspicious about the true impact of the donations, and he does not think that the answer has sufficiently proved his concerns wrong.


### Charity Organizations

Private held donor organization (Mustardseed)

- Mustardseed is a charity organization funding ground-breaking initiatives to enable a better fair world for everyone. Mustardseed is privately funded by a retired tech-savvy entrepreneur and his wife. Mustardseed is constantly on the look-out for new ways to enable communities to prosper. Being a proponent of “positive deviance” development methodology, Mustardseed is mainly donating “bottom-up” initiatives in communities, as it is convinced that this is the only true way to achieve long-term sustainable change to happen. This is based on the experience of top-down charity organizations often ending up spending lots of funds using “best-practices” which are decoupled from the reality in the community they are trying to serve. This does not build up resilient change-agents in the community who can operate independently beyond the day where the top-down donations stops.

- Mustardseed likes to measure the impact of their donations, ideally based on which demographic group that they have enabled. Mustardseed has a pretty alternative approach to economics, and are very big proponents of UBI and local currencies as enablers for communities to embrace a change-agent mindset taking responsibility of their own actions and create sustainable change.

- Mustardseed is currently spending a long time searching for projects to enable, and every process of donating is taking up a lot of time of manually setting up calls, writing summaries, getting approved by the board, wiring the funds, pollinating collaboration with other projects, checking-up on the delivery of milestones and finally reporting the impact of the projects to their stakeholder community.

Through their subject expert network, Mustardseed is aware of blockchain, local currencies, decentralized governance but it has not been able to really utilize any of this in their practices, mainly because it is too complicated to get started on using it.


### On the ground grassroot organization (Grassroots Economics)

- Grassroots Economics is a non-profit foundation based in Mombasa, Kenya. It’s co-founded by an economist woman from Kenya and an economist network scientist immigrant from the USA. Grassroots Economics has for 9 years operated local currency projects throughout Kenya, based on a believe that this type of schemes are the most efficient way to create sustainable impact within degraded and marginalized communities where there is not any accessible money available to conduct business.

- Grassroots Economics has recently entered into a partnership with Red Cross to digitize their physical local currency vouchers into a system where the end-users in the community can interact with the local currency using dial-up SMS functionality of their feature-phones in a similar way to how they are using Kenyan Shilling using M-PESA. While Grassroot economics has managed to have their convincing economic development results published in United Nations journals and been acknowledged as having a proven development methodology, Grassroot economics continues to have a struggle to be able to find donors to donate into their currency as well as funding their own operating costs in a sustainable manner. With a genuine objective and proven results to create sustainable impact in the communities they are serving, it’s frustrating for Grassroots economics they need to be constantly fundraising.

- Grassroots economics believes that the usage of blockchain technology can cut cost of their operations while enabling them to provide their stakeholders (end-donors, local governments and partner charity organizations like Red Cross) to track the impact of the donations in real-time without needing to do the costly physical check-ups.

- The usage of dedicated community currencies moreover enables the money to stay in the region where they are intended to provide an impact. Grassroots economics believes this will enable a “leveraged donation experience” with up to 20x as higher impact as with regular donations, with the additional benefit of being able to see how the actual money's spent, and how that contributes to the total economy of the individual communities using blockchain infrastructure and economic modelling. Using token-bonding curves fractionally backed by FIAT donations, it is furthermore the hope of Grassroots Economics that they can operate similar to a startup in the sense that impact investors can bet on their operations will foster economic growth, and can withdraw profits of their contributions if they are right.


### Large institutional NGO (Red Cross)

- Red Cross is aware that there’s an increasing need for proofs regarding transparency and impact and has come to the conclusion (along with WFP, UNICEF) that the more empowering donations are, such as cash-based transfers with certain restrictions, the higher the chance for achieving long-term sustainable results.

- Red Cross are supporting Grassroots Economics as they believe they might be able to deliver this by combining the transparency and efficiency of blockchain technology with the targeted economic community benefit of local currencies. This type of efficient target economic benefit building up local resilient structures while ensuring un-seen proof-of-impact as the actual spending and circulation of the money can be monitored is very promising in the eyes of Red Cross.

### Altruistic tech developers: The commons stack

- The commonstack is a group of programmers, designers and organizational driven people that are working together to build open-source software that enables a fairer and more sustainable world. Having previously developed Giveth, a non-custodial donation platform with in-build 3rd party peer-reviews, Commonstack is currently focusing on token-bonding curves and simulated programmable economics.

- Commonstack is eager to work with real world projects that are already functioning charities today and who has the aspiration to be some of the first to experiment and hopefully benefit from their technologies. Commons stack sees themselves as core infrastructure developers, and prioritize to build the fundamentals of the system that allows 3rd party developers to build up interfaces allowing crypto people and later normal people to interact with the technology.


## User-stories

As a donation end-user I want to be able to...

### Navigate to “inclusive currency campaign”

- Have an overview of communities I can donate to
- Select “Donate” to be able to see additional information and donate to that community

### Login and send funds

- Login to Dashboard wallet
- Donate Fiat via credit card or bank transfer
- Donate Crypto via DAI
- Have a notification that the transaction is processing
- Get a confirmation that my donation has been transferred to Dashboard
- Behind the scenes we will already transfer onto xDAI at this point

### Distribution of inclusive currency

- View the inclusive currency minting ratio on xDAI
- Choose between different verticals within the community to donate to including
  - all
  - Organizer such as Grassroots economics
  - Business category
  - Gender
  - Token they are using

### Mint inclusive currency by clicking a button

- Have a notification that the transaction is processing
- Get a confirmation that the inclusive currency has been created

### Impact of inclusive currency

- See the economic value of the CIC I have donated under “Donations”
- See the economic value of all CIC circulation within the selected vertical

## Withdraw from as reserve for CIC

- View the conditions of withdrawal
- View the value I can withdraw back from the CIC
- Click withdraw to make it accessible on the Dashboard
- Delegate DAI to another community
- Withdraw to DAI into an Ethereum address

## Proposed Tech-Stack

### Overview of process


![Overview of process](https://github.com/abundance-stack/donationsapp/blob/master/User-journey.png)


## Proposed implementation of each step

- UI implemented in Svelte.js - queries list of communities from MongoDB database via Node.js server

- User login with onboard.js options and uses sendwyre / moonpay API and UI widget to on-ramp fiat into DAI stable coin

- The DAI stable coin uses Ethereum mainnet to xDAI bridge to convert it into xDAI

- UI queries via Node.js server the MongoDB information regarding indexing of user-data, once pressing confirmed the xDAI is deposited into the CIC bonding curve contract and the minted CIC is distributed to the chosen recipients

- The xDAI is sent to the individual xDAI addresses, and the end-users get a notification on their feature-phones of the balance update to their address

- The donor can withdraw the donation back to DAI, according to withdraw restrictions

# Week 3-4: Developing our product

## Product Development process overview

Our product development process took part in the following iterative phases:

- Iterate user-stories / assumptions with relevant stakeholders
- Setup development environement, tooling, get access to on-ramp API
- Make first versions of mock-ups, and find svelts.js / Tailwind templates to use to implement it
- Implmeent UI v1
- Implement crypto on-ramp via onboard.js
- Implement fiat on-ramp via moonpay
- Prepare for receiving email analytics

Iterate with Will from Grassroots Economics & Griff / Kris from Commonsstack

- Research further regarding integrations with Grassroots xDAI contracts and Accenture analytics
- Define general relevant problems of social impact KPIs of bonding-curves relevant for other projects

Initial Call with Josh from Celo to scope out Celo integraiton possibilities including:

- Feedback on general concept, relevance to Celo
- Availablibility of Celo beta user-groups to partner with like we partnered with Grassroots economics
- Possibility of using on-ramp on Celo
- Features of Celo wallet and desired updated from the team
- Feasibility of Ethereum > Celo bridge

## Iterating user-stories

Before we started doing mock-ups we itereated our user-assumptions and user-stories with the following stakeholders:

- Will Ruddick from Grassroots economics
- Adam Bornstein from Danish Red Cross
- Sempo inclusive currency wallet provider
- Representatives from Mustardseed Trust
- Members of the Commonsstack collective
- Developers from Accenture working on a related token-bonding analytics dashboard 
- Our BSIC mentors

Based on this we provided smaller adjustments to the user-stories and our research and iteraeted the scope of our implementation.

## Initial iteration of user interface and experience

Our initial mock-ups were inspired by Gofundme "campaign types of UX", allowing users to set up campaigns with a fixed amount of funding needed to receive, and trusted by a validating organization, as known by Alice / Giveth blockchain donations. The difference with these campaigns is to receive the local currency versus receiving DAI / ETH.

![Landing page](https://github.com/abundance-stack/donationsapp/blob/master/Mock-up3.png)

## Second iteration of user interface and experience

In the second iteration we included text, call-to-action buttom, and modified the overview of the campaigns to have less information on them, and expanded the details page with more information on the Safaru campaign. We started to pivot in direction of Givedirect, as it became unclear for us to what extends our initial assumptions regarding identity would not be feasible to preserve the privacy and spending habits of the end-users.

## Next steps


### Iterating with stakeholders

We plan to have a second iteration with all the stakeholders we are in contact with representing our "User Personas" including:

- Will Ruddick from Grassroots economics
- Adam Bornstein from Danish Red Cross
- Sempo inclusive currency wallet provider
- Representatives from Mustardseed Trust
- Members of the Commonsstack collective

### Gitcoin Grant

We intend to launch a Gitcoin grant to get feedback on the brief explanation of our concept and userability in terms of the 
description of the concept, and to learn about:

- The perception of it's relevance from external crypto "lead user" people
- General crypto userability feedback in terms of UX / UI
- Signals regarding support from greater DeFi / Commonstack community

### Preliminary user testing

Once our product is in a stable / testable state we will iterate it with:

- The different donor types to learn about their experience
- The different end-user types to learn about their experience
- Other NGOs than Grassroots economics to learn about their experience and onboard new partners.
