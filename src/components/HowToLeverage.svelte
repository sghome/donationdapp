        Creating community currencies creates sustainable, resilient local
        economies. Here is how:
      </p>
      <p class="pb-2">
        Our partner issues credit, similar to a bank giving out loans. The
        created local currency, though can only be spent within the local
        economy. This creates a positive feedback loop, of community members
        creating businesses, selling goods and services, increasing spending. It
        accelerates the local economy and enriches its members. By keeping
        liquidity circulating locally, we provably reach higher impact on
        donations, compared to cash donations eg. via GiveDirectly.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-2">
        Issuing community currency on the blockchain, keeps donations and
        transactions transparent and cuts costs by skipping traditional
        financial intermediaries.
